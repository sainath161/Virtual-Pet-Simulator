# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Description

The Virtual Pet Simulator is an interactive web application that allows users to take care of a virtual pet. Users can feed, play with, and put the pet to sleep, which affects its attributes such as hunger, happiness, and energy. The pet's state is visually represented through different images based on its current attributes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Virtual Pet with Attributes**: The pet has three attributes: hunger, happiness, and energy.
- **Real-time Attribute Updates**: Attributes are displayed using progress bars and updated in real-time.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons to feed, play, and put the pet to sleep, which temporarily change the pet's image to reflect the action being taken.
- **Automatic Attribute Decrease**: The pet's attributes decrease over time, encouraging regular interaction.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download** the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser.
3. **Interact with the pet**:
   - **Feed**: Increases the pet's hunger attribute.
   - **Play**: Increases the pet's happiness but decreases energy.
   - **Sleep**: Increases the pet's energy.
4. **Monitor the pet's attributes** using the progress bars.
5. **Watch the pet's image** change based on its current state.
